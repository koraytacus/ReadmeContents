# Coding Exam Interface

This project is a coding exam interface designed for use in lab classrooms of faculties such as software and computer engineering. It is intended for students studying in these departments at universities. The interface resembles coding task sites like HackerRank, providing an environment for students to code live during exams.

## Features

- **Assignment and Code Editor**: The interface displays an assignment file and a code editor for the relevant programming language side by side.
- **Teacher's Control Panel**: Teachers can upload files containing instructions, student lists, and pre-written base code. They can also set the exam duration, exam name, and output directory for the final versions of the students' codes.
- **Student Login**: Students enter their student number, name, and an exam password to access the exam interface.
- **Code Execution**: The relevant programming language compiler is pulled from a Docker image based on the code file extension (.py, .java, .c) and runs in the code editor during the exam.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Teachers can select a student from the student list to view their last run code and output during the exam.
- **Code Submission**: Students can run their code and submit the final version, which is then saved to the specified output directory with their student number as the filename.
